# SuperAGI Setup Project Plan

## Project Overview
Clone, build, and set up SuperAGI - an open-source autonomous AI agent framework. Configure it to work with OpenAI API and get it fully live and ready for use.

## Repository Information
- **Source**: https://github.com/TransformerOptimus/SuperAGI
- **Description**: A dev-first open source autonomous AI agent framework enabling developers to build, manage & run useful autonomous agents
- **License**: MIT
- **Stars**: 16.4k
- **Language**: Python 70.7%, JavaScript 24.5%

## Todo Items

### Phase 1: Repository Setup
- [x] Clone the SuperAGI repository from GitHub
- [x] Explore the project structure and understand the codebase
- [x] Check requirements and dependencies
- [x] Install Docker (required for running SuperAGI)

### Phase 2: Configuration Setup
- [x] Create config.yaml from config_template.yaml
- [x] Configure OpenAI API key in the configuration
- [ ] Set up any additional required environment variables
- [x] Verify Docker and Docker Compose are available

### Phase 3: Build and Run
- [x] Build the Docker containers using docker-compose
- [x] Start all services (backend, frontend, database)
- [x] Verify all containers are running properly
- [x] Access the web interface at localhost:3000

### Phase 4: Testing and Verification
- [x] Fix backend initialization issues (Request import and dependency)
- [x] Test the GUI interface functionality
- [ ] Create a test autonomous agent
- [ ] Verify OpenAI integration is working
- [ ] Test basic agent workflows and toolkits

### Phase 5: Documentation and Review
- [ ] Document the working setup
- [ ] Identify areas for potential redesign
- [ ] Test core features and capabilities
- [ ] Prepare for redesign discussion

## Expected Deliverables
1. Fully functional SuperAGI installation
2. Working web interface accessible via browser
3. OpenAI integration configured and tested
4. Sample autonomous agent running
5. System ready for redesign evaluation

## Technical Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose
- OpenAI API key (provided)
- Web browser for GUI access
- Local development environment

## OpenAI Configuration
- API Key: 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

## Notes
